<h3><b>Summary of Project:</b></h3>
<i><font size=+1>The following is the description of our ideal website:</font></i>
<p>
<b>Goal:</b> To create a website that features interactive tools for students to use and learn from.
</p>

<b>Main page:</b><br>
        The homepage will feature a logo/banner that has animation. 
		From there, you will also be able to access three other pages that will focus on a specific topic (humanities/social studies, science/math, and miscellaneous).
		All four pages will appear coherent because they will have a similar format and background. 
		<p>
		The home page will also have a brief introduction to the website (how to use it), our aim, and orientation to the website 
		<p>
		On this page, a few links will be embedded. Some of these links will be for reaching out to the new generation through social media platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter like buttons).      
		<p>
		There will also be other features, such as a Google custom search bar and a Wikipedia search bar, for users to easily access the contents of the webpage. <br>
       
<p><b>Humanities:</b><br> 
<u>Social Studies/history</u> <br>
		Prominent figures (e.g.Prime Ministers) of Canada’s history will be featured. <br>
		This may be achieved by having pictures with scroll over shortform biographies. Or, the pictures and descriptions may be displayed on an interactive slideshow.
		<p>
		This page may also feature an interactive timeline with major events in Canada’s history. <br>
		Events will be indicated as dots on the line. When clicked, the event's detail will pop up adjacent to date on the line.<br>
 <p>
 <u>English</u><br>
		A quiz may be included on this page to test the users' knowledge on types of note taking (and/or other school related skills). This quiz will give feedback so the user can learn from it.
		<p>
		Some links, such as Sparknotes and Dictionary.com, will be included for students to use as reference as well.
                
<p><b>Science and Math:</b><br>
<u>Math</u><br>
	The math page will feature various conversion programs that we will create on our own. The conversions will mostly focus on basic formula conversions, for example the Quadratic formula and Metric conversions. <br>
	Users will input numbers in the appropriate space. The program will then convert the number and display the correct output. <br>
<p>
    There will also be a link to Wolframalpha for students who need more help. We may also include a Wolframalpha search bar on this page for students to easily access it. <br>
	<i> We will also include a short explanation on how to best use Wolframalpha, when to use it, and what to watch out for. </i><br>

<p>		 
<u>Sciences</u><br>
On this page, we will include several peer reviewed websites (e.g. Chemguy and Khan academy)
<p>
Some science videos (e.g. experiements that can be done at home) from Youtube may also be embedded on this page to stir up interest for this subject.
				 
<p><b>Extras:</b><br>
 
<u>Study spots on map of Vancouver area:<br></u>
Representative icons for the locations will be embeded into the map. Upon click or mouse over, information and/or links to the location's information will available for user.<br>
<ul>
<li>Coffee shops with internet (hours, ratings of spot depending on various factors)</li>
<li>Libraries (are computers available, printers, a lot of study space…)</li>
</ul>

<u>Supplemental information - Health and nutrition:</u><br>
	Perhaps an interactive food pyramid will be included on this page. Upon mouse over, details of food intake guidelines may appear. 
</p>
